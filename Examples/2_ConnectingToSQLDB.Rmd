## Clear console on each execute and set chunk default to not show code

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
cat('\014')
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = FALSE)
```

## Download and load libraries

```{r include=FALSE}
 if(!require("RMySQL"))
   install.packages("RMySQL")
 if(!require("dplyr"))
   install.packages("dplyr")
library(RMySQL)
library(dplyr)
```

## Establish a connection to the MySQL DB

## Test the remote connection

## Use an SQL chunk to query and store the results

## Accessing the results in an R chunk

## Use an SQL chunk to execute a query with no result

## Another way to execute a query in an R chunk

## Do NOT forget to disconnect - otherwise we may hit a remote connection limit
